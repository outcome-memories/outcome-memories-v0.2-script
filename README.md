## Tips for Safer Use

Using any **outcome memories script roblox** carries inherent risks. Follow these guidelines to minimize detection:

- 👤 **Alt Account Essential** – Never use this **outcome memories script keyless** tool on your main Roblox account. Create a dedicated alt for scripting.  
- ⚙️ **Enable Anti-Detection** – Use moderate speed multipliers (2-3x max), disable aimbot in crowded areas, and avoid obviously impossible actions.  
- 🔄 **Stay Updated** – Always use the latest v0.2 or newer version from our GitHub to ensure compatibility and safety patches.  
- 🚫 **Avoid Blatant Abuse** – Don't showcase Super Sonic transformations constantly, spam aimbot kills, or demonstrate exploits to other players.  
- 📡 **Private Servers First** – Test new features and settings in private Outcome Memories servers before using in public lobbies.  
- 🛡️ **Respectful Usage** – Excessive abuse ruins the horror experience for others and increases ban waves. Use features responsibly.  
- 🔒 **Secure Downloads** – Only download from our official GitHub or verified **outcome memories script pastebin** sources to avoid malware.  
- 📊 **Monitor Detection** – If you notice increased kicks or warnings, disable features and wait before re-enabling them.
